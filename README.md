# J1741 professional_materials

## Overview
This repo contains updated professional materials on and linked via my web development portfolio page at: https://j1741.github.io/professional_materials/

## Updates to Professional Materials
Updates in this set of professional materials include the following:

### Updates to Portfolio Page
The bio section was updated so that the tagline and developer bio describe the portfolio as one of a full-stack developer, and to note that my interest in full stack development allows me to exercise both my creative and problem-solving skill sets.

The gallery of featured applications was updated to include full-stack applications, as well as two existing front-end projects: 
- the first/top-featured application is The Beverage Viber (full-stack)
- the second-featured application is Vibe Cloud (front-end) 
- the third-featured application is the E-Commerce Backend app (full-stack)
- the fourth-featured application is the Team Profile Generator (full-stack)
- the fifth-featured application is the Password Generator (front-end)

Screenshots (including one gif!) of the featured applications, as well as links to their GitHub repositories, were all added to the gallery section. 

The resume link in the contact footer section was changed to point to my updated resume.

_Directions for future development: I'd like to change the layout of the page to have a more modern and dynamic look-and-feel, and perhaps a richer color scheme._

### Updates to GitHub Profile Page
The set of pinned repositories was updated to include all the featured applications on the portfolio page, and my mini-bio was updated to describe myself as a full-stack developer.

_Direction for future development: I'd like to add a README with a full developer profile to my GitHub profile page._

### Updates to Resume
My work experience was updated to reflect a new project on emotion detection to which I'm contributing, and my technical skills section was updated to include Node.js

_Direction for future development: I'd like to create a more developer-oriented resume, distinct from my current research-oriented one._

### Updates to LinkedIn Profile
My LinkedIn profile page was updated to describe myself as a full stack developer in addition to a linguistics researcher, and my Tools & Technologies skills section now includes full-stack development and more back-end relevant technologies (e.g. Node.js, MySQL, and MongoDB)

_Direction for future development: I'd like to update my LinkedIn profile to better integrate my linguistics and coding skill sets_
